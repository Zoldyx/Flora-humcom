                <b>The Lightning Thief</b>
                <br>RICK RIORDAN
                <p>Twelve-year-old Percy Jackson is on the most dangerous quest of his life. 
                    With the help of a satyr and a daughter of Athena, Percy must journey across 
                    the United States to catch a thief who has stolen the original weapon of mass 
                    destruction — Zeus’ master bolt. Along the way, he must face a host of mythological
                    enemies determined to stop him. Most of all, he must come to terms with a father he has
                    never known, and an Oracle that has warned him of betrayal by a friend.</p>

                <b>Maze Runner</b>
                <br>by James Dashner 
                <p>Thomas wakes up in a metal box with no memory of who he is. He only remembers his name.
                    Doors open overhead revealing a community of young boys all living on a type of farm 
                    surrounded by very high walls. The place is called the Glade. Outside the Glade, beyond
                    the walls is a massive Maze populated with monsters, known as Grievers. Every month a 
                    new boy is sent to the Glade. Each week supplies come up through the elevator that 
                    Thomas rides.Thomas learns that in the Maze outside are monsters known as Grievers. 
                    If a Griever stings you, you will go through a process known as the Changing, which 
                    is quite traumatic. Thomas meets the leader of the Glade, Alby, and his second in
                    command, Newt. There is also Chuck who becomes his friend. Gally emerges as a rival 
                    who is suspicious of Thomas. Minho is the leader of the Runners, the Gladers who go out
                    into the Maze in an attempt to map it and find a way out.

                <b>God of War</b>

                <p>It all started so simply. In the original God of War, you piloted the wrathful, ashen-skinned
                    Spartan Kratos as he tore through beasts and gods ripped from the pages of Edith Hamilton’s
                    classic Mythology on his way to enact vengeance on the titular Ares, stopping only to deliver
                    grim monologues about the tragic loss of his wife and child.Early in his adolescence, Zeus learned
                    of a prophecy that stated that one of his children
                    would eventually slay him — just as he himself had murdered his father, the Titan Cronos, 
                    to usher in the era of the gods. Zeus sent two of his children, Athena and Ares, to find
                    the fated offspring and kill them. Eventually, the two siblings determined that Deimos 
                    was the likely candidate due to strange markings on his body, and they stole him away 
                    from Kratos and delivered him to Thanatos, the god of death, giving Kratos a distinctive
                    scar over his eye when he tried to stop them.</p>
