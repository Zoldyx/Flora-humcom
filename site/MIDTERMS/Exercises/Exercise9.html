                <h2>DEVELOPMENT</h2>
                <p> Valorant was developed and published by Riot Games, who have previously developed League of Legends.[20][5] Development started in 2014, within their research and development
                    division.Joe Ziegler, Valorant's game director, is credited with the initial idea of Valorant while formulating potential games with other Riot developers.forms.</p>
                <p> When asked what kind of game KurtzPel is, the director said that it has KOG's proven action formula improved and claimed to cut out any Pay-2-Win systems. 
                    He stressed that the game is an action PvP game at the core and that related content will be developed first.</p>

                <h2>GAMEPLAY</h2>
                <p>Valorant was built with two main focuses in mind making tactical shooters and e-sports more accessible to new players: <b>Guns</b> (weapon), <b>Agents</b> (Characters), and <b>Skills</b> (Skills). 
                    The Games aimed at large, active communities and playerbases<b>w</b>a<b>s</b>d<b>right click</b> keys, to move and shoot at the game
                    <b>shift</b> key.The agent can managed to walk and be silent while other fight.Competitive matches are the same as unranked matches with the addition of a win-based ranking system which assigns a rank to each player after 5 games are played. Before you can play in competitive games,
                    you will need to win 10 unrated matches beforehand.

                    <h2>Gunplay</h2>
                    <p>The gunplay draws significant inspiration from Counter-Strike, as each weapon has a unique spray pattern. Furthermore, recoil stabilization, such as crouching, is also a prominent mechanic in the game. Crosshairs placement matters
                        too because of players clearing and holding angles the same way players would in CS.</p>

                    <p><b>BIND</b> Bind is a two site map (A and B) that has attackers infiltrating from a beach coast.</p>
                        <p>
                            A unique aspect of this map is that there are two one-way teleporters. One teleporter takes you from long B to the attacker’s side of showers.The other takes you from short A to the attacker’s side of hookah.These allow both attackers and defenders alike to quickly rotate or flank the opposing team.

                        <b>HAVEN</b> Haven is a three site map (A, B, C), which is also its unique aspect as most bomb/defusal maps in FPS games tend to be two sites.
                    </p>
                    <p>Site B is accessible through a window which leads into an outdoor courtyard. The courtyard also leads to a set of doors called “garage” which allows attackers to wrap around to Site B.
                        The garage also acts as a connector to Site C, so attackers that make it through can threaten both B and C.

                        <b>SPLIT</b> The unique mechanic here is that there are ropes that allow players to quickly ascend or descend quietly – you can find them at A Sewer, B Rafters, and Mid Vent.

                    <p>

                        <b>Ascent</b> Ascent was the first new map to be added since Valorant’s official release.
                        The courtyard offers a quick short cut to the sides of the map but is risky to cross since it doesn’t contain that much cover.

                    <p>
                        <b>Icebox</b> There are unique features such as horizontal ropes (that work identically to Split’s vertical ropes) and two-tiered
                         planting sites, meaning that you have a low ground option to plant on and a high ground one.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It’s a great map for agents like Raze, Jett, and Omen that are able to make good use of all the boxes while agents like Sova and
                        Cypher may struggle. Sova because it will be easy to hide from his sonar arrow and Cypher because there are many access points so
                        his Trapwires may not get as much value as usual.
