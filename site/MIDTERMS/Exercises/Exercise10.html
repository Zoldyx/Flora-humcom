                <h2>The Lightning Thief</h2>
                <br> RICK RIORDAN
                <p>Twelve-year-old Percy Jackson is on the most dangerous quest of his life.
                    With the help of a satyr and a daughter of Athena, Percy must journey across
                    the United States to catch a thief who has stolen the original weapon of mass
                    destruction — Zeus’ master bolt. Along the way, he must face a host of mythological
                    enemies determined to stop him. Most of all, he must come to terms with a father he
                    has never known, and an Oracle that has warned him of betrayal by a friend.

                <h2>Maze Runner </h2>
                <br>by James Dashner
                <p>Thomas wakes up in a metal box with no memory of who he is. He only remembers his name. 
                    Doors open overhead revealing a community of young boys all living on a type of farm surrounded by very high walls. 
                    The place is called the Glade. Outside the Glade, beyond the walls is a massive Maze populated with monsters, known
                    as Grievers.Every month a new boy is sent to the Glade. Each week supplies come up through the elevator that Thomas
                    rides.Thomas learns that in the Maze outside are monsters known as Grievers. If a Griever stings you, you will go 
                    through a process known as the Changing, which is quite traumatic. Thomas meets the leader of the Glade, Alby, and his
                    second in command, Newt. There is also Chuck who becomes his friend. Gally emerges as a rival who is suspicious of Thomas.
                    Minho is the leader of the Runners, the Gladers who go out into the Maze in an attempt to map it and find a way out.

                <h2>God of War</h2>
                <br>Sony's Santa Monica Studio.
                <p>It all started so simply. In the original God of War, you piloted the wrathful, ashen-skinned Spartan Kratos
                    as he tore through beasts and gods ripped from the pages of Edith Hamilton’s classic Mythology on his way to
                    enact vengeance on the titular Ares, stopping only to deliver grim monologues about the tragic loss of his wife
                    and child.Early in his adolescence, Zeus learned of a prophecy that stated that one of his children would eventually
                    slay him just as he himself had murdered his father, the Titan Cronos, to usher in the era of the gods. Zeus sent two 
                    of his children, Athena and Ares, to find the fated offspring and kill them.Eventually, the two siblings determined that
                    Deimos was the likely candidate due to strange markings on his body, and they stole him away from Kratos and delivered him
                    to Thanatos, the god of death, giving Kratos a distinctive scar over his eye when he tried to stop them.
