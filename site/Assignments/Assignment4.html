    Valorant was developed and published by Riot Games, who have previously developed League of Legends.[20][5] Development started in 2014, within their research and development
    division.Joe Ziegler, Valorant's game director, is credited with the initial idea of Valorant while formulating potential games with other Riot developers.forms.
</p>
<p>
    When asked what kind of game KurtzPel is, the director said that it has KOG's proven action formula improved and claimed to cut out any Pay-2-Win systems. 
    He stressed that the game is an action PvP game at the core and that related content will be developed first.

    Valorant was built with two main focuses in mind making tactical shooters and e-sports more accessible to new players: <b>Guns</b> (weapon), <b>Agents</b> (Characters), and <b>Skills</b> (Skills).

    Competitive matches are the same as unranked matches with the addition of a win-based ranking system which assigns a rank to each player after 5 games are played. Before you can play in competitive games,
    you will need to win 10 unrated matches beforehand.In July 2020, Riot introduced a "win by two" condition for competitive matches, teams will alternate playing rounds on attack and defense in overtime until
    a team claims victory by securing a two-match lead.where instead of playing a single sudden death round at 12-12,
</p>
<p>
    In the standard non-ranked mode, the match is played as best of 25 - the first team to win 13 rounds wins the match. The attacking team has a bomb-type device called the Spike. They must deliver and activate
    the Spike on one of the multiple specified locations (bomb sites). If the attacking team successfully protects the activated Spike for 45 seconds it detonates, destroying everything in a specific area, and they receive a point.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="gunplay"><u><font color="Black">gunplay</font></u></span><a class="toc-link" href="" title="Table of Contents"></a></h3>
<p>
    The gunplay draws significant inspiration from Counter-Strike, as each weapon has a unique spray pattern. Furthermore, recoil stabilization, such as crouching, is also a prominent mechanic in the game. Crosshairs placement matters
    too because of players clearing and holding angles the same way players would in CS.
</p>
<p>
    Summit stated Valorant‘s movement was reminiscent of that in CS. He says players experience a massive movement decrease when taking damage. While taking damage does affect the player’s speed in CSGO, it’s less severe than in its
    predecessor. Furthermore, both run boosting and boosting aren’t possible in the game. Any players slide off the back of their teammate if they attempt to raise on top.

    Each match of VALORANT takes place on a map. Maps feature a spawn area for each team, barriers that limit accessible areas during theBuy Phase, and objective sites where the spikeis to be planted. There will be four maps available at launch,
    and a 6-12 month cycle is expected for the release of new maps.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Joe_Ziegler"><font color="Blue">Joe Ziegler</font></span></h2>
<p>
    game director Joe Ziegler said that Valorant was built for people playing their first tactical shooter just as much as it was to professional players, and that accessibility of the game was a huge priority.
</p>
<p>
    Professional tactical shooter players, largely playing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, had complained for years while Valorant was in development about the CS:GO's competitive limitations in not meeting it's 
    potential for system and netcode optimizations, round-trip delay, and hit registration.<br clear="all">

<h2><span class="David Nottingham" id="David_Nottingham"><font color="Blue">David Nottingham</font></span></h2>
<p>
    game creator David Nottingham said that Valorant’s characters all have funny quips that show off their personality, and short conversations between them hint at deeper relationships. All of this comes through in
    short bursts of in-game dialogue, and Nottingham says that these lines will change over time as the Agents’ stories evolve. 
</p>
<p>None of it takes away from the gameplay or lasts more than a few seconds, and it makes for a nice break from round after round of high-tension shooting, but it’s hard to tell how much story Valorant will tell in these bits and pieces.
