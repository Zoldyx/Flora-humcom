                                <p>Five top trends for 2021 in Artificial Intelligence and Machine<br>
                                    Learning (AI/ML) for staying ahead of the curve. What is<br>
                                    important for being effective for applying algorithms in coding<br>
                                    to utilize data to solve problems?</p>
                                <p><b>Blockchain</b>, is a technology that uses a sequential set of<br>
                                    transactions leaving a defined register of events and processfor<br> 
                                    combining tasks. Fusing AI/ML and blockchain for data<br>

                                <p><b>Cloud</b>, is scalable and virtual environments. These are available<br>
                                    to set users with no physical location or provision requirement.<br>
                                    Cloud creates a different model for IT and data services by not<br>
                                    restricting architecture by physical requirements.</p>
                                <p>Ethical Artificial Intelligence, is a field, study, and<br>
                                    implementation of framework for limiting or eliminating bias in<br>
                                    algorithms. This involves evaluating a solution for data use and<br>
                                    implementation for cultural and social impact.</p>
                                <p><b>Interoperability</b>, using APIs and libraries together through<br>
                                    replication or scripting across stacks for easy implementations.<br>
                                    Having reusable and expandable blocks for coding across<br>
                                    platforms such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, SAP,<br>
                                    Snowflake, and more.</p>
                                <p><b>Security</b>, keeping data safe through stewardship. Both innovation<br>
                                    and workflow will be a topic for 2021 to enhance security<br>

                                <p>Institutions, especially in health care, are working to lower<br>
                                    the exposure of Covid-19 to patients and workers. Many private<br>
                                    and public practices have started implementing more telehealth<br>
                                    offerings such as doctor-patient video chats, A.I. avatar-based<br>
                                    diagnostics, and no-contact-based medication delivery.</p>
                                <p>Telehealth visits have surged by 50 percent compared with pre-<br>
                                    pandemic levels. IHS Technology predicted that 70 million<br>
                                    Americans would use telehealth by 2020. Since then, Forrester<br>
                                    Research predicted the number of U.S. virtual care visits will<br>
                                    reach almost a billion early in 2021.</p>
                                <p>Teladoc Health, Amwell, Livongo Health, One Medical, and Humana<br>
                                    are some of the public companies offering telehealth services to<br>
                                    meet the current needs. Startups are not far behind. Startups<br>
                                    like MDLive, MeMD, iCliniq, K Health, 98point6, Sense.ly, and<br>
                                    Eden Health have also contributed toward meeting the growing<br>
                                    needs in 2020, and will continue offering creative solutions in<br>
                                    2021. Beyond telehealth, in 2021 we can expect to see health<br>
                                    care advancements in biotech and A.I., as well as machine<br>
                                    learning opportunities (example: Suki AI) to support diagnosis,<br>
                                    admin work, and robotic health care.</p>

                                <p>Big Data, Machine Learning, and the Internet of Things (IoT)<br>
                                    were the biggest educational technology trends of 2019. However,<br>
                                    distance learning has become the one trend that rules them all.<br>
                                    The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically changed the way we teach<br>
                                    and learn. Students now have to get used to distance learning<br>
                                    via digital platforms due to social distancing. Even though some<br>
                                    schools are reopening, this trend may continue until 2021. The<br>
