                    Photography is the art, application, and practice of creating durable images by recording light, either electronically by means of an image sensor,  
                    or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film.and it is the art of capturing light with a camera, usually via a digital sensor or film, to create an image.

                <p>Camera, in photography, device for recording an image of an object on a light-sensitive surface; it is essentially a light-tight box with an aperture to admit light focused onto a sensitized film or plate. If you want to start by working on focus first,
                then read all you can on how to get the best focus from your particular camera. and it is a device that consists of a lightproof chamber with an aperture fitted with a lens and a shutter through which the image of an object is projected onto a surface for 
                recording (as on a photosensitive film or an electronic sensor) or for translation into electrical impulses
                </p>
                <p>All light behaves just like that flashlight — it travels in a straight line. But, light also bounces off of objects, which is what allows us to see and photograph objects. When light bounces off an object, it continues to travel in a straight line, but 
                it bounces back at the same angle that it comes in at.That means light rays are essentially bouncing everywhere in all kinds of different directions. The first camera was essentially a room with a small hole on one side wall. Light would pass through that hole,
                and since it’s reflected in straight lines, the image would be projected on the opposite wall, upside down. While devices like this existed long before true photography, it wasn’t until someone decided to place material that was sensitive to light at the back of 
                that room that photography was born. When light hit the material, which through the course of photography’s history was made up of things from glass to paper, the chemicals reacted to light, etching an image in the surface.</p>

                <h2>BASIC COMPONENT ON WHAT TO LEARN ABOUT PHOTOGRAPHY</h2>
                <p> Once you decide you want to become a photographer, there is a lot to learn if you really want to do it right. You need to understand f-stops, ISOs, exposure, focus modes, white balance, light, composition, focal length 
                    and how different lenses affect your images, posing for portraits, how to communicate your voice to the world through your images, and so many other things. Looking at the list all together can be overwhelming, but if you 
                    break it down, you can do it! Decide what you want to work on first and concentrate on that. If you want to start by working on focus first, then read all you can on how to get the best focus from your particular camera. 
                    </p>
                <p> If you want to understand how to get a properly exposed image first, concentrate on really understanding how ISO, f-stop and shutter speed all work together to determine the exposure of your images. Break it down into manageable
                    chunks and once one thing is second nature to you, find something else to concentrate on. If you try to get it all at once you may find yourself overwhelmed, throwing you camera back into auto, and giving up on what could be an exciting artistic outlet.</p>

            <section class="three">
                <h2>WHAT ARE LENS?</h2>
                <p>Since that first camera did not capture very much light, it actually took eight hours to take a single photograph. The image was also quite blurry. So how are we able to take sharp images in milliseconds today? A camera lens. When all of those light rays meet
                back together on a digital camera sensor or a piece of film, they create a sharp image. If the light doesn’t meet at the right point, the image will look blurry or out-of-focus. A lens’s focusing system moves the glass piece closer or farther from the sensor or film,
                allowing the photographer to adjust the lens so that the object is sharp.Distance also plays a role in how camera lenses are able to zoom in. When the front piece of glass moves farther away from the camera sensor, objects become closer. Focal length is the measurement 
                of the distance between where the light rays first hit the lens and where they reach the camera sensor. For example, on a lens with a 300mm focal length, the light takes 300 mm to be directed back into a sharp point on the camera sensor. A 300mm lens is considered a telephoto,
                or a lens that’s able to bring far objects close.

                    <h2>FILM AND DIGITAL SENSORS</h2>
                    <p>A camera lens collects and focuses the light but how is that information recorded? Historically, photographers were also chemists of sorts. Film is made up of light sensitive materials. When those materials are hit with light from the lens, they captured the shape of the objects
                        and details like how much light is coming off of them. In the dark room, the film that was exposed to the light is again put in a series of chemical baths to eventually create the image.So then how do digital cameras work? While the lenses, techniques and terms are the same, a digital 
                        camera’s sensor more closely resembles a solar panel than a strip of film. Each sensor is divided up into millions of red, green and blue pixels (i.e. megapixels). When light hits the pixel, the sensor converts it into energy and a computer built inside of the camera reads just how much
                        energy is being produced.</p>

                    <p><b>STEP 1</b>One way that images become unique is through composition. A camera’s lens is incapable of seeing everything — composition is simply a term that is used to describe what the photographer chooses to leave in, and what they chose to leave out.</p>
                        <p>
                            Adjusting composition is often as easy as moving around in a scene — think moving forward or backwards as well as side to side or even kneeling or standing on a chair. Small changes in the camera’s position can make a big impact on the photograph.Lenses
                            can also help alter a photograph’s composition. With zoom lenses, the glass is assembled in a way that allows the user to adjust how close or far away the item appears. On a compact camera, zoom is often done with a small toggle at the top of the camera,
                            while DSLR and mirrorless lenses have a twist control around the lens. Zoom is an excellent tool for cropping out distracting objects.

                        <b>STEP 2</b> Another important aspect of photography is exposure, or how light or dark the image is, and it relies on a number of different factors that, put together, determine how much light is recorded.
                    </p>
                    <p>Digital cameras have a built-in meter that measures the amount of light in a scene. While on auto, the camera’s computer chooses the correct exposure. While auto mode is not perfect and doesn’t allow you to customize the final look of the photo, you can shoot a 
                    properly exposed image (most of the time) by selecting “auto” mode inside the camera’s menu or, on more advanced cameras, a mode dial at the top of the camera.

                        <b>STEP 3</b> Newbie photographers can still adjust the exposure without learning manual modes through exposure compensation. This feature simply lightens and darkens the image. On advanced cameras, exposure compensation is often adjusted by pressing the button with a
                         + and - sign on it and turning the dial near your right thumb.

                        The feature isn’t exclusive to advanced cameras though on an iPhone, you can tap the screen, then touch the sun icon that appears and drag your finger up and down.Once you’ve chosen an exposure mode (likely auto for new photographers) and determined what to include in 
                        the composition, just press the button at the top right of the camera, right? Yes — and no.

                        <b>STEP 1</b> If you want to take pictures that have a “wow” factor built in them, the Rule of Thirds is the composition secret you need to take advantage of!
                            To use the rule of thirds, imagine four lines, two lying horizontally across the image and two vertical creating nine even squares. Some images will look 
                            best with the focal point in the center square, but placing the subject off-center at one of the intersecting points of the imaginary lines will often create
                            a more aesthetically composed photograph.When a photograph is composed using the rule of thirds the eyes will wander the frame. A picture
                            composed using the rule of thirds is usually more pleasing to the eye.When a photograph is composed using the rule of thirds the eyes will wander the frame.

                        <b>STEP 2</b> Avoid Camera Shake Camera shake or blur is something that can plague any photographer and here are some ways to avoid it.First, you need to learn how to 
                        hold your camera correctly; use both hands, one around the body and one around the lens and hold the camera close to your body for support. Also, for handheld shooting,
                        make sure that you are using a shutter speed that is appropriate for your lens’ focal length. If you’re shutter speed is too slow, any unintentional
                        movement of the camera will result in your entire photograph coming out blurry.The rule of thumb is not to shoot at a shutter speed that is slower than your focal length to minimize this problem:

                        1 / Focal Length (in mm) = Minimum Shutter Speed (in seconds)
                        
                        So, as an example, if you’re using a 100mm lens, then your shutter speed should be no lower than 1/100th of a second.
                        Use a tripod or monopod whenever possible.
